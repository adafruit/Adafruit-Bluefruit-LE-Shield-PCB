Would you like to add powerful and easy-to-use Bluetooth Low Energy to your robot, art or other electronics project? Heck yeah! With BLE now included in modern smart phones and tablets, its fun to add wireless connectivity. So what you really need is the new Adafruit Bluefruit LE Shield for Arduino!

The Bluefruit LE Shield makes it easy to add Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity to your Arduino or compatible.  Solder in the included headers and plug right in. It connects to your Arduino or other microcontroller using the hardware SPI interface (MISO, MOSI, SCK) plus a chip select line (default D8), interrupt line (default D7) and reset (default D4). You can rearrange any and all the pins if you'd like, by cutting the jumpers underneath, and soldering jumper wires to your desired pins.
